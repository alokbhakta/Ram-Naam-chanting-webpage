Ram Naam Chanting Webpage
Developed a responsive webpage for chanting the name "Ram" during breaks. This webpage features a button that, when clicked, increments a chant count and plays a soothing background audio of Ram's name. 
Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application provides an easy-to-use interface for users to engage in spiritual practice. This project demonstrates proficiency in frontend development, 
user interaction handling, and audio integration.
